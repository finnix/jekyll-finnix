\### PR EMBARGO ... DO NOT DISSEMINATE PRIOR TO MONDAY, APRIL 2, 2012 ###
  
\### RELEASE:BA\_VAD\_FINNIX ###

Seattle, Wash., April 2, 2012 -- [The Boeing Company](http://www.boeing.com/ "The Boeing Company") (NYSE: BA) today announced an agreement to acquire [Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics](https://www.velociraptors.info/vad/ "Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics"), the parent company of [Finnix](https://www.finnix.org/ "Finnix"), a LiveCD Linux operating system distribution. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

"Boeing and VAD are perfect for each other," said Ryan Finnie, president of Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics. "The acquisition of the Finnix operating system brings a wealth of opportunities to Boeing, and the resources available from Boeing are an invaluable complement to VAD's mission to bring open source system administration tools to the aerospace industry."

With the acquisition, Finnie will be retained and will head the Strategic Aeronautics and Open Source (SAOS) division of Boeing, a group focused on open source implementations of firmware for turbine and missile nose cone circuitry. Finnix will continue to be maintained as an open source product, but will benefit from the Boeing acquisition with support contracts available to leading corporations and governments. No employee reductions are anticipated.

The Boeing Company, founded in 1916, is a leading multinational aerospace and defense corporation. Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics, formed in 2011 as the parent company of Finnix, is a rising defense contractor and technology consulting company. Finnix was created in 2000 as a Linux LiveCD designed for system administrators, with a small size and low system requirements.
