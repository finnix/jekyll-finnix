title: Finnix development on Launchpad
wp_id: 330
---
I am experimenting with tracking development on [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/finnix), specifically bug tracking and new features. [A number of bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/finnix) have already been filed for the [Finnix 104 milestone](https://launchpad.net/finnix/+milestone/104). If you have a bug or a feature request not already listed, please [file a bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/finnix/+filebug) through the Launchpad interface.

The mailing list will continue to be the focal point of Finnix discussions, and Launchpad will not be used for things like package management. Still, it's already proving to be a decent bug tracking interface, and beats the method used for the previous 12 years (namely, a text file in a screen session on a development machine).
