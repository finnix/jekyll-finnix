Today is the 5 year anniversary of the "modern" incarnation of Finnix, which started with Finnix 86.0. Happy birthday, Finnix!

[I sent a message to the Finnix mailing list today](http://lists.finnix.org/pipermail/finnix/2010-October/000126.html), apologizing for hiatus Finnix has been on for the last year, and detailing a roadmap for the near future. Please read the post for the full details, but the main points are:

  * I am now working on Finnix again.
  * Finnix version numbering will jump from 93.0 to 100, and will simply increment with new releases.
  * While Finnix-PPC isn't completely dead, it is no longer a release goal.
  * The Store will be closed, and replaced with a Sticker Exchange.
