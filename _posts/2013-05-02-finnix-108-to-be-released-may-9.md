Next Thursday, May 9, Finnix 108 will be released. Finnix 108 will include Linux kernel 3.8, bug fixes and minor feature enhancements. I am experimenting with a time-based development model, and while the frequency details have not yet been finalized, this model does allow me to announce releases ahead of time.

As a reminder, Finnix releases are available several days ahead of the official release date, through BitTorrent. If you would like to get Finnix 108 as soon as possible, please see the [Finnix BitTorrent page](http://www.finnix.org/BitTorrent) for information on how to follow the release RSS seeder feeds.
