I have accepted an IS Operations position with [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com/), the makers of [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and just got back from a week of orientation. This is a great opportunity, and I'm really looking forward to the coming months as I get settled in to operations at Canonical.

I wanted to let Finnix users know what this means for the future of Finnix and how it will change. Namely, nothing should change. Finnix will continue to be my personal project. From my initial talks during the interview process, Canonical management is supportive of Finnix, but will not try to exert any control over it. Conversely, I am joining as an operations sysadmin, not as an Ubuntu developer, so I have no direct control of Ubuntu development over any other member of the Ubuntu user community.

Finnix will continue to be based on Debian; I currently use a mix of Ubuntu and Debian for my workstations and servers, and while I love Ubuntu, Debian's development process is a closer fit as a base for Finnix's development process. I will also continue to be a [Debian Maintainer](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=ryan@finnie.org), and will continue representing [Finnix as a Debian derivative](http://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census).

The decision to use [Launchpad for Finnix bug tracking](http://blog.finnix.org/2011/12/12/finnix-development-on-launchpad/) was unrelated (but has been working well so far), and actually began before I started interviewing with Canonical.
