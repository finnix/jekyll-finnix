[Host Virtual](http://vr.org/), a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider with 10 datacenter locations around the world and native IPv6 support, is now sponsoring Finnix, providing colocation and bandwidth for primary Finnix services. Finnix's services have been hosted at Host Virtual's San Jose facility for over 5 years, and all Finnix sites have had native IPv6 since early 2010.

Equally important, Host Virtual is now the latest VPS provider to provide Finnix as part of its core platform. Users can easily boot Finnix on their VMs as a rescue image for rescue, repair and maintenance of their OS installations.

[Finnix is perfectly suited for VPS providers](http://blog.finnix.org/2011/01/07/finnix-perfect-for-vps-providers/), and we are committed to working with all VPS providers to implement Finnix as a deployable option for their users.
