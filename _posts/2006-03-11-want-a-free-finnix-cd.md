title: Want a free Finnix CD?
---
<img src="/blog-media/2008/06/free-cd-screenshot.png" align="right" />Personally, I love the [printed Finnix CDs](http://www.finnix.org/Merchandise). They look nice and are very durable. This last week, I had been working on the [CD cover design](http://www.finnix.org/Image:Finnix-87.0-cd-label.png) for the upcoming 87.0 release. I went to print the CD, and the printer's self-test failed horribly. Most of the nozzles were clogged. It took about 3/4 of an inkjet cartridge set to get it to print correctly. As it turned out, I had not printed in about 3 weeks, and from Googling around, you should be printing at least every week to avoid this. Remember, this is a FEATURE.

Anyways, this gave me an idea for a contest. I will be giving away a free Finnix CD **every week**. At a random time during the week, I will flip the switch, and an icon will appear at the top-right corner of the wiki and the blog. If you see this link, simply click on it, fill out your address, and submit. For more information, please see [this link](http://www.finnix.org/Special:FreeCD).

Oh, and by the way, I just enabled it for this week. Have fun!
