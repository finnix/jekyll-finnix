title: SourceForge Downloads Pass 10,000
---
As of right now, the number of [SourceForge downloads is at 10,003](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=3892). This includes all final builds from Finnix 0.03 to present. However, this does _not_ include Finnix 0.03 downloads directly from the original site, or Finnix 86.x pre-releases. Counting those, the count is around 17,000.

Still, this is reason enough to celebrate!
