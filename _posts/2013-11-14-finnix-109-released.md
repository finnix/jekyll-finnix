title: Finnix 109 released
wp_id: 466
---
Finnix is a small, self-contained, bootable Linux CD distribution for system administrators, based on Debian testing. Finnix 109 includes a number of new features and bug fixes. Linux kernel 3.10 is included, USB 3.0 boot support has been fixed, PowerPC G5 automatic fan / thermal control has been implemented, and "nomodeset" is now passed by default, increasing boot compatibility on many Radeon graphics cards.

## Minimal build support added to Project NEALE

Project NEALE, the system to build Finnix releases, has been extended with a new "minimal" mode. This mode builds an ISO with just enough software to start up and shut down, and excludes the hundreds of sysadmin utilities found on a normal Finnix ISO. Remasterers and developers may use this as a base for their own software and utilities, rather than basing on full Finnix releases. For more information, please see the Project NEALE page.
