title: Finnix Codenames

Having a high version number just isn't enough. All of the cool distros have codenames, so I decided to jump on board. Finnix is not cool enough to have a codename such as Oscillating Ocelot; instead, I will be using places in Wisconsin, my original home state. There is certainly enough to choose from, with over 2000 cities, towns and villages in the state. However, I figured I should stick with places that 1) I've heard of, and 2) can be pronounced with relative ease. That means no Oconomowoc, Trempealeau or Nasewaupee (yes, those are all real).

First up is [Pulaski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulaski%2C_Wisconsin), a village of about 3000, about 30 minutes outside Green Bay (my hometown). Pulaski is famous for polka, and every year hosts [Polka Days](http://www.pulaskipolkadays.com/). Pulaski is also the location of the first modem bank set up at the ISP I used to work for. (I still have the number memorized after all these years, 414-822-6382, though the area code has changed since then.)
