Finnix has been confirmed as bootable on a MacBook Pro 2GHz, using [rEFIt](http://refit.sourceforge.net/). Here are the [finnix-hwsubmit results](https://www.finnix.org/submits/x86/1152082079-1135890989-787139463.gz). Ethernet works on the latest development snapshot (kernel 2.6.17), but not on 87.0.

(Thanks, Nathan!)
