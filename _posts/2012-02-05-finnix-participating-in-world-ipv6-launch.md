This is a continuation of [World IPv6 Day](http://www.worldipv6day.org/), a test launch of sites' IPv6 services on June 8, 2011.

Nothing will actually be done to Finnix on June 6. All Finnix sites (including this blog) have been IPv6 enabled for several years, and many [Finnix mirrors](http://mirrors.finnix.org/) are IPv6 enabled. Finnix is proud to be in this standing, and welcomes World IPv6 Launch to help push the internet forward into the IPv6 era.
