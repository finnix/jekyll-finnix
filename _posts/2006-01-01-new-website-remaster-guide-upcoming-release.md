To celebrate the new year, a new website has been launched. This site uses MediaWiki, and includes all content from the previous site. Since it is a wiki, if you have any info to add, just go ahead and edit! 

In addition, a remaster guide has been posted. This guide shows you how to quickly edit Finnix to suit your needs. 

"Hey, it's been over a month without a release! Are you going to take another 5 year vacation!" No, 86.2 is coming along well. All of my desired changes have been completed, I'm just waiting for Linux 2.6.15 to go gold. The 2.6.15-rc builds are working out very well, so a Finnix release will probably be made right after 2.6.15 is released.
