title: Snapshots to be Archived
---
In the next few days, I will be archiving and deleting older Finnix development snapshots. The space does add up; 7GB of snapshots since I started posting snapshots in February. If you have a need for an older snapshot, you should download it now.

The latest snapshot has been uploaded recently. It is mostly functional, with the biggest problem being some mount points/fstab entries are not being created automatically. NFS/TFTP booting is pretty stable, and has been confirmed working on the PPC platform. I will be writing documentation for NFS booting soon.
