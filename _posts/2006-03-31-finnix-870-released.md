[<img src="/blog-media/2008/06/finnix-ipod-300x267.jpg" align="right" border="0" />](http://www.finnix.org/Finnix_for_iPod)Finnix is a small, self-contained, bootable Linux CD distribution for system administrators, based on Debian testing. Today marks the release of version 87.0 for the x86, PowerPC, UML/Xen, **and iPod platforms**. 

Finnix 87.0 contains new features, including Linux kernel 2.6.16, full automatic LVM detection, console mouse support, SMP support for the PowerPC release, dynamic filesystem overlays, improved IDE DMA support, and a utility to assist with creating a bootable USB thumb drive with Finnix. **Finnix can now also be installed on the popular iPod hardware, for a total of 5 platforms Finnix can be run on,** though this new platform is still considered experimental.
