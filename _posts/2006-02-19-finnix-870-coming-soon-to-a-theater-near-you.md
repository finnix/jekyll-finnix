I declare the next version of Finnix to be named... 87.0! Enough has changed that warrants a major version bump.

Remember, if you want to see what's going on in Finnix development, see the [work in progress release notes](http://www.finnix.org/Finnix_dev_Release_Notes) that detail development as it happens, and to download a development snapshot from [snapshots.finnix.org](http://snapshots.finnix.org/).
