Yes, [yesterday's announcement](https://blog.finnix.org/2012/03/31/boeing-acquires-finnix/) was an April Fools joke, but I am humbled that enough people were convinced I could sell my company to a Fortune 500 company.

For background, the funny part is Finnix really is a product of [Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics](https://www.velociraptors.info/vad/ "Velociraptor Aerospace Dynamics"), a sole proprietorship consulting company I set up in 2011. This is mainly to make taxes easier; VAD owns the Finnix domains, pays the bills and takes the donations, at least on paper. But organizationally, it's still mostly a personal project of mine.

(The company name is an in-joke, with a secondary goal of eventually getting Department of Defense contracts based on the name alone. The company logo is a raptor riding a bomb, Slim Pickens style.)
