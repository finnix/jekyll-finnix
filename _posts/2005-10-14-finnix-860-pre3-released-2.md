[Finnix 86.0-pre3 is released!](http://www.finnix.org/) It was supposed to be 86.0-pre2, but that turned out to be a brown paper bag release (One of the last things I did was upgrade isolinux, and I tested nearly all "finnix" combinations of booting, but not "memtest"... it broke horribly.)

Anyways, download it (it's just over 100MB for god sakes), test it, and let me know what breaks, if anything.
