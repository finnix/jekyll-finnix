title: Finnix 86.0-pre3 Released
wp_id: 38

Finnix version 86.0-pre3 has been released today. This is a public pre-release, intended to flush out as many bugs as possible before the big release. Because it is a pre-release, its CD layout is not optimized, and as a result you may hear some random seeks from older CDROM drives. Other than that, the CD is quite usable (I've been using it at work for a couple days now). If you find any bugs or issues, please use the bug tracking system to report it.
