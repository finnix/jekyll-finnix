[www.finnix.org](http://www.finnix.org) now has a minor facelift, because as [somebody](http://sneakums.livejournal.com/) mentioned, the default color scheme made you momentarily think you were on Wikipedia. The new design is still basically Monobook (Wikipedia's default skin), but now has a unmistakable blue theme at the top.

Additionally, [the blog](http://www.finnix.org/blog/) has a new theme that... kinda fits in with the rest of the site.
