Over the weekend, <tt>humorbot</tt>, the main x86 development machine for Finnix, suffered a hard drive crash. Thankfully, the crash wasn't absolute, and I was able to mount the dev partition read-only and copy/verify the last generated dev ISO snapshot. (All snapshots are GPG-signed, which in times like this helped make sure there was no corruption on that particular file.) This, combined with a full backup made on the 2nd, meant that thankfully no development work was lost.
