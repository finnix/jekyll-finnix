title: New content on Finnix CDs in the store
wp_id: 14
---
In order to justify using a 700MB CDR to burn a 100MB distro (and possibly the $6 price tag), Finnix CDs bought through [the store](http://www.finnix.org/Merchandise) now include over 300MB of extra content not included with the downloadable version. This includes all packages needed to install Debian "sarge" via debootstrap, as well as stage 1, 2 and 3 Gentoo tarballs. Now you can effectively install either Debian or Gentoo without ever going out to the Internet.
