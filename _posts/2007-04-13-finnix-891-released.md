---
Finnix is a small, self-contained, bootable Linux CD distribution for system administrators, based on Debian testing. Today marks the release of version 89.1 for the x86/AMD64, PowerPC, and UML/Xen platforms.

Finnix 89.1 is a maintenance and bugfix release. Base system has been dist-upgraded to Debian's 2007-04-03, the day etch was marked stable. "testcd" boot option has been fixed on the PowerPC platform. The ipcalc package has been added, and the finnix-3ware-install package has been upgraded to 9.4.1. ssh-agent is now started at boot-time, and is shared among all VTs.
