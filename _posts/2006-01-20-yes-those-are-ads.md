I added a small Google AdWords block to the top-right of [the wiki](http://www.finnix.org/). I did this because 1) the extra money would be nice, and 2) I had an AdWords account sitting idle. It seems to blend in well and should be relatively unintrusive, but if you have any suggestions, let me know. _Today's Earnings: $0.32_ Woo! I'm almost up to a free stamp!

If you are interested in doing something similar on your MediaWiki site, I [wrote a short blurb](http://www.finnix.org/Google_AdSense_on_MediaWiki) about how I did it.

(Ironically, most of the ads I've seen so far has been for Knoppix and Xandros.)
