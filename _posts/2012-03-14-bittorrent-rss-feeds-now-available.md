RSS feeds of Finnix ISO BitTorrent releases are now available. These feeds allow you to (with supported clients) automatically download and seed the latest versions of Finnix. There are several feeds available, but the recommended feed is here:

  * <http://www.finnix.org/rss/bittorrent/seeder.rss>

This feed contains the last two releases in both x86 and PPC flavors. The approximate download size is 450MB for the 4 ISOs. Additionally, before Finnix releases are made, this feed will be updated with the unreleased version, usually at least a few days before release. This way, you automatically help build the seeds in preparation for a release, and you can get new Finnix releases before they are officially released! 

For more information, see [the BitTorrent page](http://www.finnix.org/BitTorrent) on [finnix.org](http://www.finnix.org/).
