title: Finnix 86.2 on Linode
wp_id: 10
---
The 86.2 update has been successfully tested on [Linode](http://www.linode.com/), and I've been told it should be deployed to all hosts this evening. With 86.2, UML/Xen detection is now automatic, and you no longer need the "uml" or "xen" boot parameter (though it doesn't hurt anything if you leave it in).

If you are a UML/Xen provider, and want to offer Finnix as a recovery/sysadmin distribution, see [this page](http://www.finnix.org/Architectures), or drop me a line (ryan@finnie.org) and I can help you get it integrated with your platform.
