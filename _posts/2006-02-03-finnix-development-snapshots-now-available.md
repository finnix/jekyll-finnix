title: Finnix development snapshots now available
---
[snapshots.finnix.org](http://snapshots.finnix.org/) is now live, where you can download the latest development build of both Finnix and Finnix-PPC. Development builds are not guaranteed to be stable, but I try to make sure that they are at least bootable.

Snapshots are updated every other day, beginning at approximately 4AM Pacific. However, since they are being uploaded from a cable modem line, it may be up to 3 hours until new snapshots become available. The site is password-protected and changed daily to gently discourage non-human downloading, but the password is displayed in the login prompt. For example, today's login information is <tt>snapshots:hither</tt>.
