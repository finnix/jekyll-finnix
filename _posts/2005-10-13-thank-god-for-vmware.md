In the last week, I'm guessing that I've built and started approximately 500 ISOs, if not more.

In TOTALLY unrelated news, I've started work on [Finnix](http://www.finnix.org/) again. I've almost got a stable product, and the website is completely redone.

(Check out the [screenshots](http://www.finnix.org/Screenshots).)

Update: Yeah, I forgot to mention, it's not out yet... but soon!
