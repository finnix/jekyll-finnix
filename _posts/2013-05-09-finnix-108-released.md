Finnix is a small, self-contained, bootable Linux CD distribution for system administrators, based on Debian testing. Today I am pleased to announce the release of Finnix 108, which includes Linux kernel 3.8, updated Debian upstream software, bug fixes and minor feature enhancements.

  * Home page: <http://www.finnix.org/>
  * Download: <http://www.finnix.org/Download>
  * Release notes: [http://www.finnix.org/Finnix\_108\_release_notes](http://www.finnix.org/Finnix_108_release_notes)
  * Free stickers! <http://www.finnix.org/Free_stickers>

Note that Finnix 108 was frozen shortly before Debian 7.0 wheezy was released, so the userland is effectively based on Debian stable for this release.
