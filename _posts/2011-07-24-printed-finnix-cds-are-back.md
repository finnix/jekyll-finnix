With the release of [Finnix 102](https://www.finnix.org/Finnix_102_release_notes), I have once again begun printing [high-quality, glossy CDs](https://www.finnix.org/Support_Finnix#Printed_Finnix_CD). These are not your typical inkjet CD-Rs you find at the local computer store. They are Taiyo Yuden WaterShield CDs, have a high-gloss finish, are highly resistant to smudging, and are more durable than a typical CD-R. And they look beautiful.

And as an exclusive, these CDs are hybrid bootable x86/PowerPC CDs. Simply insert it in any x86 or PowerPC computer and boot. This version is _not available for download_, so the only way to receive one of these hybrid CDs is [by donation](https://www.finnix.org/Support_Finnix#Printed_Finnix_CD).

You can get a printed Finnix CD with any donation of $20 or more. You will also receive some [stickers](https://www.finnix.org/Free_stickers) with your donation. And if you are not interested in CDs and/or stickers, but still want to help out, there are other ways you can help [support Finnix](https://www.finnix.org/Support_Finnix).
